## Overview

- A weather dashboard with form inputs that will run in the browser and feature a five-day forecast and dynamically updated HTML and CSS.   - The base URL for your API calls should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`.

### The Challenge

- Build a Weather Dashboard using the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5), you'll need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name.
- Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).
  
### Acceptance Criteria


* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
